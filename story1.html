      <h2>Trump Faces New Legal Challenge as FBI Investigate 300 Refugees for Links to ISIS</h2>
      <h4>March 6, 2017 by Naomi Smith</h4>
      <p>
        President Donald Trump today signed a new executive order placing a 90-ban on individuals from six majority-Muslim countries entering the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        The order, which includes a 120-day ban on all refugees, will come into effect on 16th March. The executive order replaces the initial controversial travel which President Trump instituted via executive order.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new ban has already been met with threats of legal action. New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said that he is scrutinizing the action and is ready to challenge it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/06/donald-trump-travel-ban-nigeria-executive-order/">He said</a> that “while the White House may have made changes to the ban, the intent to discriminate against Muslims remains clear. This doesn’t just harm the families caught in the chaos of President Trump’s draconian policies – it’s diametrically opposed to our values, and makes us less safe.”
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the Department of Homeland Security today informed congressman that the FBI was investigating 300 individuals who were admitted to the US as refugees.
      </p>
      <p>
        All 300 refugees are part of 1,000 counterterrorism investigations involving or inspired by the so-called Islamic State group, according to congressional sources. No details were given as to the cases or time frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speculation has arisen that the announcement of the investigations was timed to support President Trump’s ban.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the new order, all refugee arrivals will be stopped for a period of 120-days, not 180 <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/06/donald-trump-travel-ban-nigeria-executive-order/">as reported earlier today</a> by The Telegraph.
