      <h2>Britain Puts Limit on Unaccompanied Minors</h2>
      <p>
        Britain’s government has placed a limit on the number of lone child refugees it will accept into the country, citing fears that people-traffickers are exploiting the system. 350 children will be allowed in under the Dubs Amendment— far fewer than the 3,000 originally expected under the law that had been aimed at helping some of the tens of thousands of unaccompanied migrant children across Europe.
